To take the joined flanking sequences of the IS insertion point and analyse them by sequence conservation, 
I wrote the weblogo generation script AtaideLab - Github\Targets\Flanks to Weblogo Scripts_Rezwan\Scripts\Weblogomultipng3_RS.py
This will take a folder full of concatenated flanking sequences in fasta format from an input folder, 
and generate a weblogo output folder with .png files. 

If 20 bp flanks are selected, insertion point is after 20th bp. 
If 60 bp flanks are selected, insertion point is after 60th bp.
